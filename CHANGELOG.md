## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- Initial release of the `gaming` network discovery and reachability CLI.
- Pluggable discovery sources: `rdap`, `whois`, `asn_bgp` (RIPEstat/BGP),
  `peeringdb`, `rir`, each with graceful offline sample-data fallback.
- Filtering by country, ASN, provider, and organization, plus Iranian- and
  foreign-datacenter focus modes.
- Prefix normalization: validation, de-duplication with metadata merge, and
  optional CIDR collapsing.
- Reachability: concurrent local alive checks (`ping`/`tcp`/`auto`), TCP port
  probing, and opt-in global reachability via check-host.net (public IPs only).
- Output to console, JSON, and CSV.
- Layered configuration (defaults → TOML → CLI overrides), logging,
  thread-pool concurrency, and fail-soft error handling.
- CLI subcommands: `sources`, `discover`, `check`, `run`.
- Test suite (52 tests, fully offline) and packaging for distribution.
